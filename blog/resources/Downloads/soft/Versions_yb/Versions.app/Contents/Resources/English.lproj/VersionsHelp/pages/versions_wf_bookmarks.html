			<h2>Repositories and working copies</h2>
			<p>The bookmarks list on the left hand side of the Versions main window contains all repositories and working copies that you have bookmarked. See the <a class="internal" href="getting_started.html">Getting started</a> section for instructions on how to add new bookmarks.</p>
		
			<div class="screenshot bookmarks"></div>
			
			<p class="caption">Bookmark folders with repository and working copy bookmarks.</p>
		
			<p>The small badges next to working copy bookmark show how many items have changes. A blue badge indicates changes in the remote repository, while the yellow badge indicates local changes in your working copy.</p>
		
			<h2>Grouping and organizing bookmarks</h2>
			<p>Versions automatically places new working copy bookmarks under the correct repository and adds a repository bookmark for a working copy if necessary. To organize them further, you can group a set of bookmarks into a single folder. You can do this by selecting &ldquo;New Bookmarks Folder&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Bookmarks&rdquo; menu, then dragging any bookmarks or other folders into the  folder you just created.</p>
			<p>To rename a folder, select the folder in the bookmarks list, then click on the name of the folder again. You can also control+click the folder and choose &ldquo;Rename Folder...&rdquo; in the contextual menu that appears.</p>
			<p>When you delete a bookmarks folder, every bookmark in it will be deleted too. To remove the folder and keep its contents, control+click the folder and select &ldquo;Ungroup&rdquo; from the contextual menu. To make this a bit easier, Versions presents you with the option to ungroup a folder instead of deleting it when you try to delete a folder that contains any bookmarks or sub-folders.</p>
		
			<h2>Zestful bookmarking</h2>
			<p>If you use a single repository for multiple projects, it&#39;s still possible to organize your bookmarks by project. Add one bookmark for the top level of your repository and several more repository bookmarks under it, each with a URL that points to a sub-folder in the repository. If your repository requires authentication, you will only need to enter your username and password once.</p>
			<p>With a setup of nested repository bookmarks, the Timeline for each bookmark will only contain items that are relevant to each bookmark&#39;s sub-folder in the repository.</p>
