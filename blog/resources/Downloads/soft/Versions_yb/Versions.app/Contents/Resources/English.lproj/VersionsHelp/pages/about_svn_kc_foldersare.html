			<h2>Setting properties</h2>
			<p>Subversion stores everything it needs to know about the files in your repositories and working copies at the &lsquo;folder level&rsquo;. You can configure special Subversion <span class="term">properties</span> for both folders and files, but folders have a different set of configurable properties than regular files.</p>
			<h2>Making changes</h2>
			<p>When you add or modify a file, you can commit just that one file. But, when you have scheduled a file for deletion, keep in mind that Subversion considers that a change to the folder that contains the file, instead of to the file itself. It&#39;s easy to get the hang of, as long as you  remember that folders are special in Subversion&mdash;and we mean that in a good way.</p>
			<p>See the section titled <a href="about_svn_kc_workingcopies.html">Working copies</a> for a primer on adding, deleting and committing changes.</p>
