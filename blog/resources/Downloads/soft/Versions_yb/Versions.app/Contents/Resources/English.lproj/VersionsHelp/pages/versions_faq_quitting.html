			<h2>Why does Versions show me the &ldquo;Quitting Versions...&rdquo; dialog?</h2>
			<p>When you quit Versions, there may still be some Subversion activity in progress. This can include an <span class="term">update</span> or <span class="term">commit</span> action that you started, as well as automatic refreshes of the change counters in the bookmarks list.</p>
		
			<p>By default, Versions waits for the graceful termination and cleanup of all background activity and server connections. This usually takes just a second or so, but may take up to a couple of minutes when there is a lot going on. You can skip this wait and force background activity to be terminated immediately by clicking the &ldquo;Quit Now&rdquo; button.</p>
