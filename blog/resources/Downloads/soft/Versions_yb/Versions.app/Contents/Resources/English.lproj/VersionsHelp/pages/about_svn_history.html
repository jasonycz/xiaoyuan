		<h1>Some history</h1>
		<div class="contents">
			<h2>Initial development</h2>
			<p><a  href="http://www.collab.net" target="_blank">CollabNet, Inc.</a> kick-started Subversion development in early 2000. Their aim was to create a better, open-source replacement for <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System" target="_blank">CVS</a>, the then-dominant version control system. Subversion shares the same basic principles of CVS, but was created from scratch to avoid its bugs and limitations.</p>
			<h2>Where it is right now</h2>
			<p>Subversion has since been adopted by a tremendous amount of different companies and organizations, resulting in steady continued development of Subversion itself, and the creation of a wide variety of Subversion <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Subversion_clients" target="_blank">client applications</a>.</p>
			<p>In November 2009, Subversion joined the <a href="http://www.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Software Foundation</a>, becoming &ldquo;Apache Subversion&rdquo; three months later. Although there are organizations that still use CVS, Subversion is now the world&#39;s most used centralized version control system.</p>
