			<h2>Your project master vault</h2>
			<p>A Subversion <span class="term">repository</span> is the central, authoritative place where Subversion stores your files. You can create a repository on your own computer, set one up on a server of your own, or use a specialized Subversion hosting provider like <a href="https://www.assembla.com/plans?affiliate=VersionsApp" target="_blank">Assembla</a> to set up a ready-to-use online repository with a couple of clicks.</p>
	
			<p>You will rarely modify your repository directly. Common usage is to <span class="term">checkout</span> a <a class="internal" href="about_svn_kc_workingcopies.html">working copy</a> of your repository on your own computer, make changes there and from time to time <span class="term">commit</span> the changes you want to keep to the repository.</p>

			<h2>What&#39;s in a repository</h2>
			<p>Any collection of files and folders can be imported into a repository to manage them with Subversion. A repository does not only offer access to the current version of its contents, you can browse and checkout any previous revision that&#39;s stored in there too.</p>
		
			<p>Normally, each project gets its own repository. So if you use Subversion both to develop an application and a website to market that application, both projects will likely have their own repository.</p>
